# Release Sanity Checker

This tool helps you ensure the consistency of your API responses over time. It fetches responses for a set of pre-defined requests, compares them against previous responses stored in a database, and reports any differences.  This is particularly useful for regression testing and ensuring that API changes don't introduce unexpected behavior.

## üöÄ How to run

- **Download binary**  
Download your preferred version from [releases](https://github.com/drew458/release-sanity-checker/releases) and just run `release-sanity-checker <FILENAME>`.

- **Container**  
Assuming you have Podman or Docker installed on your machine:
    - ```bash
      podman build -t release-sanity-checker .
      ```
    - ```bash
      podman run -v "./examples/example-post.json:/app/config.json" release-sanity-checker --ignore-headers config.json
      ```
    
    If you want to run it against a directory, use:  
    - ```bash
      podman run -v "./examples/:/app/examples/" release-sanity-checker --directory ./examples
      ```
 
## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage

```bash
release-sanity-checker [options] <config_path>
```

### üïπÔ∏è Options

    --file <config_path>: Run with a specific config file (default mode).
    --directory <dir_path>: Run with all config files found in the directory.
    --ignore-headers: Do not look for changes in response headers.
    --baseline: Build the baseline for the requests. This will overwrite existing responses in the database with the current responses.
    --verbose: Print the full response body/header when changed and response that didn't change.

### üö¶ Examples

- **Build the baseline**

```bash
release-sanity-checker --baseline config.json
release-sanity-checker --baseline --directory examples
```

- **Run with a specific config file**

```bash
release-sanity-checker config.json
release-sanity-checker --file config.json
```

- **Run with all .json files in a directory**

```bash
release-sanity-checker --directory examples
```

- **Ignore header changes**

```bash
release-sanity-checker --file config.json --ignore-headers
```

## ‚úÖ Configuration File Format

**Requests object**

The configuration file is a JSON file containing an array of request definitions. Each request definition must have the following fields:

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| id | String | Y | A unique identifier for the request |
| flow | Array | Y | The HTTP requests to run. Only the last one will be checked for differences in the response |
| ignore_paths | Array | N | A list of path to ignore in the response when checking for differences |

**Flow object**

| Name | Type | Mandatory | Description | 
|---|---|---|---|
| url | String | Y | The URL to make the request to |
| headers | Object | N | A map of headers to include in the request |
| body | Object | N | The request body (can be any valid JSON value) |

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## üìä Database

The tool uses a SQLite database file named `release-sanity-checker-data.db` to store previous responses. This file is created in the current working directory along with the WAL files (`release-sanity-checker-data.db-shm` and `release-sanity-checker-data.db-wal`).
